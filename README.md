## Part A: Warming Up with LEDs

### 0 - Using your new found (or honed skill) of Morse code, what message did Jason in the comic on the first page tap out?

### 1 - Hooray! You just wrote your first AVR C code! Take a screenshot of your code. It should only be a few lines. No need to include the “include <avr/io.h>” or header file lines. Just the main function.  (Refer to the examples in lecture.)

Lorem ipsum

### 2 - Take a screenshot of your code. It should only be a few lines. No need to include the “include <avr/ioh.h>” lines. Just the main function.  (Refer to the examples in lecture.)

Lorem ipsum

### 3 - Take a screenshot of your code. It should only be a few lines. No need to include the “include <avr/ioh.h>” lines. Just the main function.  (Refer to the examples in lecture.)

### 4 - Use CircuitLab to draw your schematic. Attach an image to your answer to this question

Lorem ipsum

## Part B: Now, Using Interrupts

### 5 - Give an advantage and a disadvantage to using interrupts over polling for this task

Lorem ipsum

## Part C: Dash or Dot

### 6 - For a 16MHz clock, how many “ticks” are in 30ms, 200ms, and 400ms?

Lorem ipsum

### 7 - Describe how a prescaler allows us to work with a wider range of frequencies on our microcontroller

Lorem ipsum

## Part D: Putting It Together - LEDs and ASCII

### 8 - Submit a link to a demo video

Lorem ipsum

## Part E: The (Dot) Dash to the Finish

### 9 - Write a program that takes in a message or word, translates it to morse code, and then flashes an LED according to the morse code generated. Since we haven’t learned about serial communication yet, the message/word can be a hardcoded string in your code that you manually edit, compile, and flash each time you want to change the word. Submit a video of this demo
